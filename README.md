# soundoku

## Purpose
Soundoku is a Sudoku game with the goal of being accessible to blind and visually impaired players. It is important to the creator, Max, to specify that while the goal of the game is to be accessible, it may not live up to that goal just yet.  Soundoku was made in Max's internship at Demiurge during a month long game jam.  

## How to Play
When an Alpha is ready for testing, a link will appear here: 

Soundoku consists of a 4 by 4 sudoku grid. Each number is represented by a different sound. Currently, there are 3 main ways of interacting with the puzzle -
1. Double clicking an empty slot and pressing the 1,2,3, or 4
2. Double clicking an empty slot to select it, and double clicking on any of the numbered pieces on the left of the screen 
3. Drag and dropping numbered pieces on the left of the screen into the slots

### Controls: 
Double Left Click on any Box to select that Box for editing
Double Left Click on any Piece to input that Piece's value into the Selected Box for editing
You can also press the 1, 2, 3, or 4 keys to input the value into any Selected Box
Right Click on any Box or Piece to hear its value
To scan through all the boxes' positions and values, press F
While your cursor is on top of any Box, you can press: 
	R to scan the entire Row of that box
	C to scan the entire Column of that box 
	G to scan the entire Subgrid of that box 
To Cancel any scan, press the Control Key
You may press Space at any time to hear  what values the sounds correspond to
Press M to open the Pause Menu

## Next Steps 
Update the interface so that a user could play with just the keyboard, not needing to use a mouse, which can be imprecise. 
Playtest, playtest, playtest!
